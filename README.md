# ED50 to ETRS89/WGS84 coordinates transformation
Webservice for Spanish coordinates' transformation from ED50 UTM to ETRS89/WGS84.

NTv2 grids are provided by [Instituto Geografico Nacional espa√±ol](http://www.ign.es/web/gds-rejilla-cambio-datum). They also provide a [SOAP webservice](https://www.ign.es/wcts-app/) to make the transformation but it only works with GML files.
